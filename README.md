# The wheel of standup

> "Who wants to run standup today?"

> tumble weed

> crickets

Sounds familiar? Here's a Chrome extension to solve this issue!

## How it works

Click on the extension icon when you're in a Google Meet call.

Make sure you have the sidebar with all participants open (click that icon with the little people!).

Copy the names of all participants on the call to your clipboard, then open the [Wheel of Names](https://wheelofnames.com/) with the handy link provided and paste the names. Lastly: spin the wheel!


## How to install it in your Chrome browser in three easy steps

1) Clone or download this code.

2) Go to `chrome://extensions/` and turn on "Developer mode" in the top right.

3) Click on "Load unpacked" in the top left and point it to the root of this directory (wherever you saved it on your computer).
